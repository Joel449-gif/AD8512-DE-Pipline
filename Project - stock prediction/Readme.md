# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project aims to predict future stock prices of a particular company using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is designed to capture long-term dependencies and is widely used in time-series analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the historical stock prices of a particular company. The dataset consists of the date, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and volume of trades for each trading day.

## Prerequisites
Python 3 <br> 
TensorFlow <br>
Keras <br>
Pandas <br>
Numpy <br>
Matplotlib <br>

You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy matplotlib

## Usage
1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Open the stock.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
4. Run each cell in the notebook to train the LSTM model and predict the stock prices.
5. The predicted stock prices will be displayed in a line plot.

## Results
The accuracy of the stock price prediction model depends on several factors, including the quality and quantity of the data, the hyperparameters of the LSTM model, and the market conditions. Therefore, the accuracy of the model may vary for different companies and time periods.
